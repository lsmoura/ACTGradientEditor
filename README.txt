ACTGradientEditor

Intro:
	ACTGradientEditor is a gradient editor designed to be simple and easy to use. It works with NSGradient, close to the way NSColorWell works with NSColor. Most of the color, size, etc settings are hardcoded with #define statements, but it isn’t difficult to change them into @propertyes if you need to.

How to use:
	- To add a color double-click anywhere
	- To delete a color drag it out of the gradient
	- To edit a color (bring up the color picker) double-click it
	- To move a color drag it along the gradient
